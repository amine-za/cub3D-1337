# CUB3D

This project is inspired by two games, the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever, and Doom game that needs no further identification. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
